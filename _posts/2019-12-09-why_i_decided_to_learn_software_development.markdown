I decided to learn software development since , evidently, my Math degree is not enough to get a job in a desirable field for me. So, I thought, since I'm fairly computer literate, software development would be a good avenue to pursue, in lieu of other opportunities. Furthermore, a lot of computer programming is based on systems of explicit rules and their uses and the implications of their uses which is similar to the kind of work I did whilst pursuing my degree.

Another reason I decided to learn software development is because of just how much of the modern world relies on computers and computer systems, thus making it a stable job field as people will always be innovating and creating new systems and inadvertantly creating new problems to overcome. In this way, a skilled software engineer pulls double duty as an innovater and as a repairman of sorts.
